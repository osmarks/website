        date: "2015-11-01",
        excerpt: "Twenty years ago, law enforcement organizations lobbied to require data and communication services to engineer their products to guarantee law enforcement access to all data. After lengthy debate and vigorous predictions of enforcement channels “going dark,” these attempts to regulate security technologies on the emerging Internet were abandoned. In the intervening years, innovation on the Internet flourished, and law enforcement agencies found new and more effective means of accessing vastly larger quantities of data. Today, there are again calls for regulation to mandate the provision of exceptional access mechanisms. In this article, a group of computer scientists and security experts, many of whom participated in a 1997 study of these same topics, has convened to explore the likely effects of imposing extraordinary access mandates. We have found that the damage that could be caused by law enforcement exceptional access requirements would be even greater today than it would have been 20 years ago. In the wake of the growing economic and social cost of the fundamental insecurity of today’s Internet environment, any proposals that alter the security dynamics online should be approached with caution. Exceptional access would force Internet system developers to reverse “forward secrecy” design practices that seek to minimize the impact on user privacy when systems are breached. The complexity of today’s Internet environment, with millions of apps and globally connected services, means that new law enforcement requirements are likely to introduce unanticipated, hard to detect security flaws. Beyond these and other technical vulnerabilities, the prospect of globally deployed exceptional access systems raises difficult problems about how such an environment would be governed and how to ensure that such systems would respect human rights and the rule of law."

        date: "2023-03-23",
        excerpt: "“Zen 4” is AMD's next generation x86-64 microprocessor core, fabricated in a 5nm FinFET process. Close collaboration between the design team and TSMC enabled an optimized process and excellent process scaling relative to the 7nm process used for “Zen 3”. The 55mm2 core complex (CCX), shown in Fig. 2.1.1, contains 6.5B transistors across eight cores, similar to the 8 core CCX in the previous generation. Each core includes a 1MB private L2 cache, double the previous generation, and the eight cores share a 32MB L3 cache. The design also delivers a process-neutral performance increase over “Zen 3”: instructions per cycle (IPC) is increased, the physical design improves process-neutral frequency and changes are made to drive improved power efficiency maximizing both single-threaded performance and performance per watt in multi-threaded workloads. Incremental improvements to the core micro-architecture provide a 13% IPC improvement over the previous generation on an average of single-threaded desktop applications and the “Zen 4” core can operate at up to 5.7GHz delivering a more than 29% increase generationally in single-threaded performance."

        excerpt: "Current state-of-the-art approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms generate indices that must be stored in main memory for fast high-recall search. This makes them expensive and limits the size of the dataset. We present a new graph-based indexing and search system called DiskANN that can index, store, and search a billion point database on a single workstation with just 64GB RAM and an inexpensive solid-state drive (SSD). Contrary to current wisdom, we demonstrate that the SSD-based indices built by DiskANN can meet all three desiderata for large-scale ANNS: high-recall, low query latency and high density (points indexed per node). On the billion point SIFT1B bigann dataset, DiskANN serves > 5000 queries a second with < 3ms mean latency and 95%+ 1-recall@1 on a 16 core machine, where state-of-the-art billion-point ANNS algorithms with similar memory footprint like FAISS and IVFOADC+G+P plateau at around 50% 1-recall@1. Alternately, in the high recall regime, DiskANN can index and serve 5 - 10x more points per node compared to state-of-the-art graph-based methods such as HNSW and NSG. Finally, as part of our overall DiskANN system, we introduce Vamana, a new graph-based ANNS index that is more versatile than the existing graph indices even for in-memory indices."
