Reality does not bow to expectations. Expectations merely mask what is. This is what it is.

I'm osmarks, also known as gollark in some places.
I enjoy bending the world to my will and creating confusing and/or funny things through applied computer science and mathematics, among other things.
You can contact me through [email](mailto:me@osmarks.net), <span class="hoverdefn" title="My username is 'gollark'">Discord</span>, <a href="https://apionet.gh0.pw/">IRC</a> sometimes, <span class="hoverdefn" title="please note that the monitoring sampling interval is 15 seconds">Morse code transmitted via HTTP request volumes</span>, carrier pigeon, or [ActivityPub (Mastodon)](https://b.osmarks.net/).
Friend me on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/friends)! My code is `1997726_vJHwaMCvTGs6hTAsxuhvUtwuF7TMgkBK`.

## My work

* [Meme Search Engine](https://github.com/osmarks/meme-search-engine)/[Nooscope](https://nooscope.osmarks.net), state-of-the art meme (and other image) search technology. [Automatic quality scoring](/memethresher/) and [230-million-item index](/memescale/)!
* [4D Tic-Tac-Toe](/tictactoe4/), one of the somewhat difficult games in the world.
* [Untitled Objection Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIoFMnkvRA5PggXaYGQ2QJPEH8LPDm5Dd), a metafictional work about decision theory, Solomonoff induction and `#off-topic`.
* [osmarkscalculator](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Osmarkscalculator), an esolang and/or computer algebra system based on string rewriting.
* [Advancing Consensus: Automated Persuasion Networks for Public Belief Enhancement](https://sigbovik.org/2024/proceedings.pdf#page=192), a groundbreaking work on large-scale opinion improvement. Won the SIGBOVIK 2024 award for "Most Frighteningly Like Real Research".
* [This website](/), with its many esoteric capabilities and content.
* [The infrastructure backing it](/srsapi/), which remains oddly reliable despite its considerable complexity.
* [PotatOS](https://potatos.madefor.cc/), an advanced operating system for [ComputerCraft](https://tweaked.cc/) with a capability-based sandboxing model, powerful multitasking, reliable automatic updates and "Copilot" capabilities substantially predating Windows's.
* [OnStat](https://status.osmarks.net/), a lightweight(ish) status page I use here.
* [Minoteaur 8](https://github.com/osmarks/minoteaur-8), the world's most osmarks-designed, Minoteaur-like note-taking application.
* [Project LIMINAL OCTOTHORPE](https://github.com/osmarks/liminal-octothorpe), a slightly functional AI agent implementation for internet-based forecasting.
* [A lot of code](https://github.com/osmarks/misc/tree/master/computercraft) for miscellaneous control/monitoring/automation tasks in Minecraft.
* [Many other short scripts](https://github.com/osmarks/misc/) accessible to the public.

## Skills

* Programming in all cool languages (Python, JavaScript, Rust, Lua, Nim, Haskell).
* Programming in several uncool languages (C, Java), but only ironically.
* Vague knowledge of contemporary machine learning frameworks and algorithms.
* Expert knowledge of ComputerCraft (Minecraft mod).
* Rapid prototyping (accursed hacks very fast).
* (Arch) Linux (btw) systems administration.
* Mechanical keyboard.
* Causing inscrutable networking problems.
* Bench press: 85kg (4RM).
* Nigh-omniscient knowledge of and concern for English grammar.
