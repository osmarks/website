I have been thinking about [ComputerCraft](https://tweaked.cc/) slightly recently, because of moving [several years of archived code](https://github.com/osmarks/random-stuff/tree/master/computercraft) from Pastebin and some private internal repositories to public view (and writing some minor patches to [PotatOS](https://potatos.madefor.cc/)), and it increasingly seems like a model of what computers *should* be like which highlights the shortcomings of everything else.

Computers undoubtedly grow more powerful every year, as fabs wrangle quantum electrodynamics into providing ever better and smaller transistors at great cost and the handful of companies still at the cutting edge refine their architectures slightly, but, [as has been noted](https://danluu.com/input-lag/), this doesn't actually translate into better user experience.
