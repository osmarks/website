We dissect the IPU's performance behavior using microbenchmarks that we crafted for the purpose. We study the IPU's memory organization and performance. We study the latency and bandwidth that the on-chip and off-chip interconnects offer, both in point-to-point transfers and in a spectrum of collective operations, under diverse loads. We evaluate the IPU's compute power over matrix multiplication, convolution, and AI/ML primitives. We discuss actual performance in comparison with its theoretical limits. Our findings reveal how the IPU's architectural design affects its performance. Moreover, they offer simple mental models to predict an application's performance on the IPU, on the basis of the computation and communication steps it involves. This report is the natural extension to a novel architecture of a continuing effort of ours that focuses on the microbenchmark-based discovery of massively parallel architectures.",

In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.",

In the first ``local'' phase, a classical search algorithm is used to produce many desirable constructions. In the second ``global'' phase, a transformer neural network is trained on the best such constructions. Samples from the trained transformer are then used as seeds for the first phase, and the process is repeated. We give a detailed introduction to this technique, and discuss the results of its application to several problems in extremal combinatorics. The performance of PatternBoost varies across different problems, but there are many situations where its performance is quite impressive. Using our technique, we find the best known solutions to several long-standing problems, including the construction of a counterexample to a conjecture that had remained open for 30 years.",

        "excerpt": "In this paper, we present empirical evidence of skills and directed exploration emerging from a simple RL algorithm long before any successful trials are observed. For example, in a manipulation task, the agent is given a single observation of the goal state and learns skills, first for moving its end-effector, then for pushing the block, and finally for picking up and placing the block. These skills emerge before the agent has ever successfully placed the block at the goal location and without the aid of any reward functions, demonstrations, or manually-specified distance metrics. Once the agent has learned to reach the goal state reliably, exploration is reduced. Implementing our method involves a simple modification of prior work and does not require density estimates, ensembles, or any additional hyperparameters. Intuitively, the proposed method seems like it should be terrible at exploration, and we lack a clear theoretical understanding of why it works so effectively, though our experiments provide some hints.",

Our approach leverages a new search algorithm, HyperTree Proof Search (HTPS), inspired by the recent success of AlphaZero. Our model learns from previous proof searches through online training, allowing it to generalize to domains far from the training distribution. We report detailed ablations of our pipeline's main components by studying performance on three environments of increasing complexity. In particular, we show that with HTPS alone, a model trained on annotated proofs manages to prove 65.4% of a held-out set of Metamath theorems, significantly outperforming the previous state of the art of 56.5% by GPT-f. Online training on these unproved theorems increases accuracy to 82.6%. With a similar computational budget, we improve the state of the art on the Lean-based miniF2F-curriculum dataset from 31% to 42% proving accuracy.",

Twitter declares that it does not use such a practice, sometimes arguing about the occurrence of \"bugs\" to justify restrictions on some users. This paper is the first to address the plausibility or not of shadow banning on a major online platform, by adopting both a statistical and a graph topological approach. We first conduct an extensive data collection and analysis campaign, gathering occurrences of visibility limitations on user profiles (we crawl more than 2.5 million of them). In such a black-box observation setup, we highlight the salient user profile features that may explain a banning practice (using machine learning predictors). We then pose two hypotheses for the phenomenon: i) limitations are bugs, as claimed by Twitter, and ii) shadow banning propagates as an epidemic on user-interactions ego-graphs. We show that hypothesis i) is statistically unlikely with regards to the data we collected. We then show some interesting correlation with hypothesis ii), suggesting that the interaction topology is a good indicator of the presence of groups of shadow banned users on the service.",

This study examined whether non-expert readers could reliably differentiate between AI-generated poems and those written by well-known human poets. We conducted two experiments with non-expert poetry readers and found that participants performed below chance levels in identifying AI-generated poems (46.6% accuracy, χ2(1, N = 16,340) = 75.13, p < 0.0001). Notably, participants were more likely to judge AI-generated poems as human-authored than actual human-authored poems (χ2(2, N = 16,340) = 247.04, p < 0.0001). We found that AI-generated poems were rated more favorably in qualities such as rhythm and beauty, and that this contributed to their mistaken identification as human-authored. Our findings suggest that participants employed shared yet flawed heuristics to differentiate AI from human poetry: the simplicity of AI-generated poems may be easier for non-experts to understand, leading them to prefer AI-generated poetry and misinterpret the complexity of human poems as incoherence generated by AI.",

        "excerpt": "With the recent proliferation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models capable of mimicking human artworks, AI creations might soon replace products of human creativity, although skeptics argue that this outcome is unlikely. One possible reason this may be unlikely is that, independent of the physical properties of art, we place great value on the imbuement of the human experience in art. An interesting question, then, is whether and why people might prefer human-compared to AI-created artworks. To explore these questions, we manipulated the purported creator of pieces of art by randomly assigning a “Human-created” or “AI-created” label to paintings actually created by AI, and then assessed participants’ judgements of the artworks across four rating criteria (Liking, Beauty, Profundity, and Worth). Study 1 found increased positive judgements for human-&nbsp;compared to AI-labelled art across all criteria. Study 2 aimed to replicate and extend Study 1 with additional ratings (Emotion, Story, Meaningful, Effort, and Time to create) intended to elucidate why people more-positively appraise Human-labelled artworks. The main findings from Study 1 were replicated, with narrativity (Story) and perceived effort behind artworks (Effort) moderating the label effects (“Human-created” vs. “AI-created”), but only for the sensory-level judgements (Liking, Beauty). Positive personal attitudes toward AI&nbsp;moderated label effects for more-communicative judgements (Profundity, Worth). These studies demonstrate that people tend to be negatively biased against AI-created artworks relative to purportedly human-created artwork, and suggest that knowledge of human engagement in the artistic process contributes positively to appraisals of art.",

        "excerpt": "It would be very convenient if the individual neurons of artificial neural networks corresponded to cleanly interpretable features of the input. For example, in an “ideal” ImageNet classifier, each neuron would fire only in the presence of a specific visual feature, such as the color red, a left-facing curve, or a dog snout. Empirically, in models we have studied, some of the neurons do cleanly map to features. But it isn't always the case that features correspond so cleanly to neurons, especially in large language models where it actually seems rare for neurons to correspond to clean features. This brings up many questions. Why is it that neurons sometimes align with features and sometimes don't? Why do some models and tasks have many of these clean neurons, while they're vanishingly rare in others?",

        "excerpt": "One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks' internals is \\textit{polysemanticity}, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is \\textit{superposition}, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task \\citep{wang2022interpretability} to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability.",

        "excerpt": "Sparse autoencoders provide a promising unsupervised approach for extracting interpretable features from a language model by reconstructing activations from a sparse bottleneck layer. Since language models learn many concepts, autoencoders need to be very large to recover all relevant features. However, studying the properties of autoencoder scaling is difficult due to the need to balance reconstruction and sparsity objectives and the presence of dead latents. We propose using k-sparse autoencoders [Makhzani and Frey, 2013] to directly control sparsity, simplifying tuning and improving the reconstruction-sparsity frontier. Additionally, we find modifications that result in few dead latents, even at the largest scales we tried. Using these techniques, we find clean scaling laws with respect to autoencoder size and sparsity. We also introduce several new metrics for evaluating feature quality based on the recovery of hypothesized features, the explainability of activation patterns, and the sparsity of downstream effects. These metrics all generally improve with autoencoder size. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach, we train a 16 million latent autoencoder on GPT-4 activations for 40 billion tokens. We release training code and autoencoders for open-source models, as well as a visualizer.",

I got very solid performance off the same baseline AMD EPYC Rome system that has been at the core of our entire journey 😁 That initial parts selection has remained fantastic! Owners of that system are going to get some great news today also as they can hit between 4.25 to 3.5 TPS (tokens per second) on the Q4 671b full model. This is important as the distilled versions are simply not the same at all. They are vastly inferior and other models out perform them handily. Running the full model, with a 16K or greater context window, is indeed the pathway to the real experience and it is worthwhile. Since this runs decent enough on CPU alone it also can hang out while you run smaller models, like vision models, at the same time. To reiterate, this will not fully run in only GPU VRAM alone unless you have a massive rig. I will show you all the tips and tricks to get this working.

The series was created by Howard Overman and stars Stephen Mangan as holistic detective Dirk Gently and Darren Boyd as his sidekick Richard MacDuff. Recurring actors include Helen Baxendale as MacDuff's girlfriend Susan Harmison, Jason Watkins as Dirk's nemesis DI Gilks and Lisa Jackson as Dirk's receptionist Janice Pearce. Unlike most detective series Dirk Gently features broadly comic touches and even some science fiction themes such as time travel and artificial intelligence.",

Dreamer learns a model of the environment and improves its\nbehaviour by imagining future scenarios. Robustness techniques based on\nnormalization, balancing and transformations enable stable learning across\ndomains. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is, to our knowledge, the first\nalgorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or\ncurricula. This achievement has been posed as a substantial challenge in\nartificial intelligence that requires exploring farsighted strategies from\npixels and sparse rewards in an open world. Our work allows solving challenging\ncontrol problems without extensive experimentation, making reinforcement\nlearning broadly applicable.",

        "excerpt": "The importance, tractability and neglectedness framework, or ITN framework for short, is a framework for estimating the value of allocating marginal resources to solving a problem based on its importance, tractability, and neglectedness.\n\n\nHistory\nThe  ITN framework was first developed by Holden Karnofsky around 2013 as part of his work for GiveWell Labs (which later became Open Philanthropy).[1]\n\n80,000 Hours later presented its own, quantitative version of the framework.[2] On this version, developed by Owen Cotton-Barratt in late 2014,[3] the three factors are formally defined as follows:\n\n * importance  = good done / % of a problem solved\n * tractability = % of a problem solved / % increase in resources\n * neglectedness = % increase in resources / extra person or dollar\n\nWhen these terms are multiplied, some of the units cancel out, resulting in a quantity denominated in good done per extra person or dollar.\n\nOther differences between Karnofsky's model and Cotton-Barratt's are the terminology (\"importance, tractability and uncrowdedness\" is replaced by \"scale, solvability and neglectedness\") and the use of problems rather than causes as the main unit of analysis.\n\nMore recently, in an article introducing the SPC framework, Will MacAskill, Teruji Thomas and Aron Vallinder replace neglectedness with leverage, a factor that describes how the work already being done on a problem affects the cost-effectiveness of additional work. The resulting framework generalizes to problems with constant or increasing returns to additional work, whereas the ITN framework remains appropriate for problems with diminishing, especially logarithmic, returns.[4][5]\n\n\nFurther reading\n80,000 Hours (2016) Our current list of especially pressing world problems, 80,000 Hours, June.\nA set of applications of the ITN framework.\n\nDickens, Michael (2016) Evaluation frameworks (or: when importance / neglectedness / tractability doesn't apply), Philosophical Multicore, June 10.\nA criticism of the I",

        "excerpt": "Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms are a key part of the modern deep learning stack due to enabling efficient similarity search over high-dimensional vector space representations (i.e., embeddings) of data. Among various ANNS algorithms, graph-based algorithms are known to achieve the best throughput-recall tradeoffs. Despite the large scale of modern ANNS datasets, existing parallel graph based implementations suffer from significant challenges to scale to large datasets due to heavy use of locks and other sequential bottlenecks, which 1) prevents them from efficiently scaling to a large number of processors, and 2) results in nondeterminism that is undesirable in certain applications.\n  In this paper, we introduce ParlayANN, a library of deterministic and parallel graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms, along with a set of useful tools for developing such algorithms. In this library, we develop novel parallel implementations for four state-of-the-art graph-based ANNS algorithms that scale to billion-scale datasets. Our algorithms are deterministic and achieve high scalability across a diverse set of challenging datasets. In addition to the new algorithmic ideas, we also conduct a detailed experimental study of our new algorithms as well as two existing non-graph approaches. Our experimental results both validate the effectiveness of our new techniques, and lead to a comprehensive comparison among ANNS algorithms on large scale datasets with a list of interesting findings.",

When the query data is drawn from a different distribution - e.g., when index represents image embeddings and query represents textual embeddings - such algorithms lose much of this performance advantage. On a variety of datasets, for a fixed recall target, latency is worse by an order of magnitude or more for Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) queries as compared to In-Distribution (ID) queries. The question we address in this work is whether ANNS algorithms can be made efficient for OOD queries if the index construction is given access to a small sample set of these queries. We answer positively by presenting OOD-DiskANN, which uses a sparing sample (1% of index set size) of OOD queries, and provides up to 40% improvement in mean query latency over SoTA algorithms of a similar memory footprint. OOD-DiskANN is scalable and has the efficiency of graph-based ANNS indices. Some of our contributions can improve query efficiency for ID queries as well.",

As a proxy objective, we design and train a neural network that favors uniformity in the spherical latent space, while preserving the neighborhood structure after the mapping. We propose a new regularizer derived from the Kozachenko--Leonenko differential entropy estimator to enforce uniformity and combine it with a locality-aware triplet loss. Experiments show that our end-to-end approach outperforms most learned quantization methods, and is competitive with the state of the art on widely adopted benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that training without the quantization step results in almost no difference in accuracy, but yields a generic catalyzer that can be applied with any subsequent quantizer.",

For high-accuracy operating points, multi-codebook quantization associates data vectors with one element from each of multiple codebooks. An example is residual quantization (RQ), which iteratively quantizes the residual error of previous steps. Dependencies between the different parts of the code are, however, ignored in RQ, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion performance. QINCo recently addressed this inefficiency by using a neural network to determine the quantization codebook in RQ based on the vector reconstruction from previous steps. In this paper we introduce QINCo2 which extends and improves QINCo with (i) improved vector encoding using codeword pre-selection and beam-search, (ii) a fast approximate decoder leveraging codeword pairs to establish accurate short-lists for search, and (iii) an optimized training procedure and network architecture. We conduct experiments on four datasets to evaluate QINCo2 for vector compression and billion-scale nearest neighbor search. We obtain outstanding results in both settings, improving the state-of-the-art reconstruction MSE by 34% for 16-byte vector compression on BigANN, and search accuracy by 24% with 8-byte encodings on Deep1M.",

        "excerpt": "Given a vector dataset $\\mathcal{X}$ and a query vector $\\vec{x}_q$, graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) aims to build a graph index $G$ and approximately return vectors with minimum distances to $\\vec{x}_q$ by searching over $G$. The main drawback of graph-based ANNS is that a graph index would be too large to fit into the memory especially for a large-scale $\\mathcal{X}$. To solve this, a Product Quantization (PQ)-based hybrid method called DiskANN is proposed to store a low-dimensional PQ index in memory and retain a graph index in SSD, thus reducing memory overhead while ensuring a high search accuracy. However, it suffers from two I/O issues that significantly affect the overall efficiency: (1) long routing path from an entry vertex to the query's neighborhood that results in large number of I/O requests and (2) redundant I/O requests during the routing process. We propose an optimized DiskANN++ to overcome above issues. Specifically, for the first issue, we present a query-sensitive entry vertex selection strategy to replace DiskANN's static graph-central entry vertex by a dynamically determined entry vertex that is close to the query. For the second I/O issue, we present an isomorphic mapping on DiskANN's graph index to optimize the SSD layout and propose an asynchronously optimized Pagesearch based on the optimized SSD layout as an alternative to DiskANN's beamsearch. Comprehensive experimental studies on eight real-world datasets demonstrate our DiskANN++'s superiority on efficiency. We achieve a notable 1.5 X to 2.2 X improvement on QPS compared to DiskANN, given the same accuracy constraint.",

Recent advances in graph-based indices have made it possible to index and search billion-point datasets with high recall and millisecond-level latency on a single commodity machine with an SSD.\n  However, existing graph algorithms for ANNS support only static indices that cannot reflect real-time changes to the corpus required by many key real-world scenarios (e.g. index of sentences in documents, email, or a news index). To overcome this drawback, the current industry practice for manifesting updates into such indices is to periodically re-build these indices, which can be prohibitively expensive.\n  In this paper, we present the first graph-based ANNS index that reflects corpus updates into the index in real-time without compromising on search performance. Using update rules for this index, we design FreshDiskANN, a system that can index over a billion points on a workstation with an SSD and limited memory, and support thousands of concurrent real-time inserts, deletes and searches per second each, while retaining $>95\\%$ 5-recall@5. This represents a 5-10x reduction in the cost of maintaining freshness in indices when compared to existing methods.",

        "excerpt": "Snakebite envenoming remains a devastating and neglected tropical disease, claiming over 100,000 lives annually and causing severe complications and long-lasting disabilities for many more1,2. Three-finger toxins (3FTx) are highly toxic components of elapid snake venoms that can cause diverse pathologies, including severe tissue damage3 and inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in life-threatening neurotoxicity4. At present, the only available treatments for snakebites consist of polyclonal antibodies derived from the plasma of immunized animals, which have high cost and limited efficacy against 3FTxs5–7. Here we used deep learning methods to de novo design proteins to bind short-chain and long-chain α-neurotoxins and cytotoxins from the 3FTx family. With limited experimental screening, we obtained protein designs with remarkable thermal stability, high binding affinity and near-atomic-level agreement with the computational models. The designed proteins effectively neutralized all three 3FTx subfamilies in vitro and protected mice from a lethal neurotoxin challenge. Such potent, stable and readily manufacturable toxin-neutralizing proteins could provide the basis for safer, cost-effective and widely accessible next-generation antivenom therapeutics. Beyond snakebite, our results highlight how computational design could help democratize therapeutic discovery, particularly in resource-limited settings, by substantially reducing costs and resource requirements for the development of therapies for neglected tropical diseases. Deep learning methods have been used to design proteins that can neutralize the effects of three-finger toxins found in snake venom, which could lead to the development of safer and more accessible antivenom treatments.",

        "excerpt": "Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.",

        "excerpt": "Air-gapped systems are disconnected from the Internet and other networks because they contain or process sensitive data. However, it is known that attackers can use computer speakers to leak data via sound to circumvent the air-gap defense. To cope with this threat, when highly sensitive data is involved, the prohibition of loudspeakers or audio hardware might be enforced. This measure is known as an `audio gap'.\n  In this paper, we present PIXHELL, a new type of covert channel attack allowing hackers to leak information via noise generated by the pixels on the screen. No audio hardware or loudspeakers is required. Malware in the air-gap and audio-gap computers generates crafted pixel patterns that produce noise in the frequency range of 0 - 22 kHz. The malicious code exploits the sound generated by coils and capacitors to control the frequencies emanating from the screen. Acoustic signals can encode and transmit sensitive information. We present the adversarial attack model, cover related work, and provide technical background. We discuss bitmap generation and correlated acoustic signals and provide implementation details on the modulation and demodulation process. We evaluated the covert channel on various screens and tested it with different types of information. We also discuss \\textit{evasion and stealth} using low-brightness patterns that appear like black, turned-off screens. Finally, we propose a set of countermeasures. Our test shows that with a PIXHELL attack, textual and binary data can be exfiltrated from air-gapped, audio-gapped computers at a distance of 2m via sound modulated from LCD screens.",

Although air-gap computers have no wireless connectivity, we show that attackers can use the SATA cable as a wireless antenna to transfer radio signals at the 6 GHz frequency band. The Serial ATA (SATA) is a bus interface widely used in modern computers and connects the host bus to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives. The prevalence of the SATA interface makes this attack highly available to attackers in a wide range of computer systems and IT environments. We discuss related work on this topic and provide technical background. We show the design of the transmitter and receiver and present the implementation of these components. We also demonstrate the attack on different computers and provide the evaluation. The results show that attackers can use the SATA cable to transfer a brief amount of sensitive information from highly secured, air-gap computers wirelessly to a nearby receiver. Furthermore, we show that the attack can operate from user mode, is effective even from inside a Virtual Machine (VM), and can successfully work with other running workloads in the background. Finally, we discuss defense and mitigation techniques for this new air-gap attack.",

Existing NLOS methods temporally probe the indirect\nlight transport to unmix light paths based on their travel\ntime, which mandates specialized instrumentation that suffers from low photon efficiency, high cost, and mechanical\nscanning. We depart from temporal probing and demonstrate steady-state NLOS imaging using conventional intensity sensors and continuous illumination. Instead of assuming perfectly isotropic scattering, the proposed method\nexploits directionality in the hidden surface reflectance,\nresulting in (small) spatial variation of their indirect reflections for varying illumination. To tackle the shapedependence of these variations, we propose a trainable architecture which learns to map diffuse indirect reflections to\nscene reflectance using only synthetic training data. Relying on consumer color image sensors, with high fill factor,\nhigh quantum efficiency and low read-out noise, we demonstrate high-fidelity color NLOS imaging for scene configurations tackled before with picosecond time resolution.",

Yet, this knowledge is often hard to extract, and may be hard to understand or learn from. Here, we show that this is possible by proposing a new method that allows us to extract new chess concepts in AlphaZero, an AI system that mastered the game of chess via self-play without human supervision. Our analysis indicates that AlphaZero may encode knowledge that extends beyond the existing human knowledge, but knowledge that is ultimately not beyond human grasp, and can be successfully learned from. In a human study, we show that these concepts are learnable by top human experts, as four top chess grandmasters show improvements in solving the presented concept prototype positions. This marks an important first milestone in advancing the frontier of human knowledge by leveraging AI; a development that could bear profound implications and help us shape how we interact with AI systems across many AI applications.",

        "excerpt": "Biological evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations, often surprising the scientists who discover them. However, because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.",

This is enabled by Gigaflow, a batched simulator that can synthesize and train on 42 years of subjective driving experience per hour on a single 8-GPU node. The resulting policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on three independent autonomous driving benchmarks.

By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4$\\times$ more more data. Chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7% improvement over Gopher.",

However, scaling demands predictability: we want methods to not only perform well with more compute or data, but also have their performance be predictable from small-scale runs, without running the large-scale experiment. In this paper, we show that value-based off-policy RL methods are predictable despite community lore regarding their pathological behavior. First, we show that data and compute requirements to attain a given performance level lie on a Pareto frontier, controlled by the updates-to-data (UTD) ratio. By estimating this frontier, we can predict this data requirement when given more compute, and this compute requirement when given more data. Second, we determine the optimal allocation of a total resource budget across data and compute for a given performance and use it to determine hyperparameters that maximize performance for a given budget. Third, this scaling behavior is enabled by first estimating predictable relationships between hyperparameters, which is used to manage effects of overfitting and plasticity loss unique to RL. We validate our approach using three algorithms: SAC, BRO, and PQL on DeepMind Control, OpenAI gym, and IsaacGym, when extrapolating to higher levels of data, compute, budget, or performance.",

EfficientZero's performance is also close to DQN's performance at 200 million frames while we consume 500 times less data. EfficientZero's low sample complexity and high performance can bring RL closer to real-world applicability. We implement our algorithm in an easy-to-understand manner and it is available at https://github.com/YeWR/EfficientZero.

        "excerpt": "Deep learning (DL) creates impactful advances following a virtuous recipe: model architecture search, creating large training data sets, and scaling computation. It is widely believed that growing training sets and models should improve accuracy and result in better products. As DL application domains grow, we would like a deeper understanding of the relationships between training set size, computational scale, and model accuracy improvements to advance the state-of-the-art.\n  This paper presents a large scale empirical characterization of generalization error and model size growth as training sets grow. We introduce a methodology for this measurement and test four machine learning domains: machine translation, language modeling, image processing, and speech recognition. Our empirical results show power-law generalization error scaling across a breadth of factors, resulting in power-law exponents---the \"steepness\" of the learning curve---yet to be explained by theoretical work. Further, model improvements only shift the error but do not appear to affect the power-law exponent. We also show that model size scales sublinearly with data size. These scaling relationships have significant implications on deep learning research, practice, and systems. They can assist model debugging, setting accuracy targets, and decisions about data set growth. They can also guide computing system design and underscore the importance of continued computational scaling.",

In this work, we demonstrate that scaling can also lead to substantial improvements. We conduct a thorough investigation into the interplay of scaling model capacity and domain-specific RL enhancements. These empirical findings inform the design choices underlying our proposed BRO (Bigger, Regularized, Optimistic) algorithm. The key innovation behind BRO is that strong regularization allows for effective scaling of the critic networks, which, paired with optimistic exploration, leads to superior performance. BRO achieves state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming the leading model-based and model-free algorithms across 40 complex tasks from the DeepMind Control, MetaWorld, and MyoSuite benchmarks. BRO is the first model-free algorithm to achieve near-optimal policies in the notoriously challenging Dog and Humanoid tasks.",

A transition is enabled if all places connected to it as inputs contain at least one token. Some sources[1] state that Petri nets were invented in August 1939 by Carl Adam Petri — at the age of 13 — for the purpose of describing chemical processes.",

        "excerpt": "stub ATX12VO is a new-ish power supply spec published by Intel in July of 2019 that eliminates the 3.3V and 5V rails from power supplies, leaving only the 12V rail. The spec has become a hot buzzword lately because Tier 2 of the California Energy Commision’s Title 20 goes into effect on July 1st, 2021, and these stricter energy regulations were a large part of why the ATX12VO spec was written. We’ve spoken to Intel, a major power supply manufacturer, and a power supply factory on the subject, the latter two off-record, and today we’ll be reporting their thoughts. We’ll also be defining the ATX12VO spec and what it means for computing, along with Intel’s goals for the specification.   We should start with this notice: 12VO, in a sense, isn’t actually new. Companies like Dell, HP, and Lenovo -- especially HP -- have been using a form of power supplies with only 12V in their systems for a long time now. In these systems, the motherboards are outfitted with all the DC-to-DC bucks and boosts necessary for drives. Although these have existed, they weren’t standardized and often used proprietary connectors or power supplies. The difference today is that Intel is moving to standardize these types of power supplies, and the primary reason is to more easily meet efficiency requirements set by government bodies. These regulations apply to pre-built systems, not to DIY enthusiast systems, but the recent question has been whether that’ll slowly creep outward from pre-built and into DIY. A lot of pre-builts, especially fromtraditional OEMs, use motherboards that can’t be bought retail. Higher-end gaming pre-builts use retail motherboards, which is where questions start to emerge. Note that this was already published as a video on our channel, found here: Let’s start with some background. Intel published the original ATX (no -12VO) spec for motherboards and PSUs back in 1995 and the ATX12V (no -O) spec in 2000, from which we can draw two important conclusions: first, ATX12VO is a revision of Intel’s own technology rather than Intel attempting to seize the reins out of nowhere, and second, the ATX12V spec is old. Technically, ATX refers to the form factor and general design (currently on version 2.2) and ATX12V refers to specifically PSU features (currently on version 2.52). Note that the Intel ATX12V spec is also responsible for such things as a 120mv ripple requirement, highlighting just how old this is. Power supplies provide 12V, 5V, and 3.3V power to motherboards, divided into three distinct “rails.” Of the cables included with most modern PSUs, there are 5V or 3.3V pins only in the 24-pin ATX, MOLEX 4-pin, and SATA power connectors. PCIe 6/8 pin connectors, ATX12V, and EPS12V connectors use only 12V and ground. 3.3V and 5V rails are mostly used for things like some RGB strips on 5V, some peripherals, and storage devices. Most MOLEX 4-pin connectors only use 12V and ground, skipping the 5V line altogether. 3.3V and 5V power is used much less in PCs now than it was when the ATX spec was being written decades ago, and is being used less all the time, so Intel has published a PSU spec they call “12 Volt Only” (12VO). ATX12VO uses a single 10-pin connector to replace the existing 24-pin ATX connector, and as the name implies, the PSU would provide nothing but a single rail of 12V power across all cables. The spec includes a full set of electrical and physical guidelines for building a PSU that will be compatible with 12VO systems, including CFX, LFX, SFX, TFX, and Flex ATX versions (CFX12VO, LFX12VO, etc.), as well as recommendations for connectors and cables. We’re focused on ATX12VO, but the idea is the same for all of them. When we asked Intel what their objectives were with 12VO, their response was “ATX12VO is one of Intel’s efforts to improve efficiency across OEM/SI systems and products from industry partners. One of the immediate objectives of ATX12VO is to help meet multiple government energy regulations. The most recent government energy regulations require OEMs to use extreme low system idle power levels to reduce desktop idle power consumption [...] There are many benefits to all desktop segments, including a smaller connector, more flexible board designs, and improved energy conversions. ATX12VO is not only for small desktops.” The main advantage to eliminating the other voltages is efficiency, in terms of cables, price, and power consumption. To the first point, removing more than half of the pins from the main power connector makes it less bulky, as we’ve already seen on Intel’s Compute Element (or Ghost Canyon NUC), which uses a 10-pin 12VO plug. The 24-pin ATX cable is invariably the largest and most difficult cable to secure in a desktop, and it governs the size of cable cutouts in every PC case. Intel’s new spec has this to say about motherboard connectors and power passthrough: ATX12VO makes the main power connector smaller, but it doesn’t eliminate the work of stepping down 12V power for things like SATA and USB devices--it just shunts it over to the motherboard, taking up valuable real estate there and shifting cost from one product to another. The motherboard also must now supply its own SATA power connectors, so it remains to be seen how much tidier a full-size ATX12VO layout would be. This creates a significant imposition on real-estate for motherboards, especially enthusiast motherboards that are already packed with ICs and interfaces. From Intel: “Motherboard connectors for these type of devices are needed and described in the ATX12VO specification Section 4.3. Motherboard designers will have to decide how many devices and the power to provide to these types of devices for the 5V and 12V power. If the device is 12V only – like some LEDs, fans, or liquid cooling solutions – the 1x4 Peripheral connector still exists as an optional connector, but only 12V and ground pins can be provided by the power supply.” The 1x4 connector refers to MOLEX, which can provide both 5V and 12V power but is sometimes used just for 12V. PSU manufacturers would have the option of providing MOLEX connectors with just the 12V and ground pins connected. CPU 4- and 8-pin connectors remain unchanged. Making a PSU that supplies 12V power exclusively is obviously simpler than making one which supplies 12V, 5V, and 3.3V, and it’s potentially cheaper as well. Fewer cables, less internal hardware, and less engineering required to make an ATX12VO PSU. Again, the work eliminated from the PSU side is just shunted over to the motherboard side, so the cost of the system as a whole may not decrease. It’s logical to think that since the ATX12VO power connector is a cut-down version of the existing 24-pin connector that existing ATX PSUs would be compatible with ATX12VO motherboards using an adapter cable, but it’s more complicated than that. When asked if it would be possible to use a passive adapter cable, Intel responded with the following: “The main problem with using an existing Multi-Rail ATX power supply to power a new ATX12VO motherboard is the 12V Standby Rail. The existing Multi Rail ATX Power Supplies use a 5VSB rail. This would have to be converted to a 12VSB rail to work with ATX12VO motherboards. The new standby rail of 12V was determined by working with power supply vendors and motherboard manufacturers to determine the best overall efficiency. There were minor efficiency differences between 12VSB and 5VSB. Keeping the new power supplies as 12V/12VSB only was the best option to improve overall power efficiency.” It sounds like compatibility isn’t totally ruled out, but it won’t be as simple as just hooking up the right pins. PSUs are expected to have a longer span of usefulness than motherboards on average, so this could be an important point if ATX12VO is ever going to win over the DIY community. We reached-out to a power supply engineer at a large company and confirmed that a 5VSB to 12VSB adapter is possible and already exists, because ATX12VO is similar in ways to power supplies that Lenovo, HP, and Dell already have for OEM systems. One could take an HP-to-ATX12V adapter and re-pin it to work with 12VO, for example. Anyone who’s checked the spec out for themselves may have noticed that it’s entitled “Single Rail Power Supply Desktop Platform Form Factors ATX12VO (12 V Only).” We’ve confirmed with Intel that “single-rail” refers to the fact that there are no 5V or 3.3V rails; the spec allows for multiple 12V rails. “Multiple” 12V rails in a desktop PSU usually means a single 12V rail split up for increased safety rather than literal discrete rails, but that’s a subject for another day. Intel stated that “OEMs may consider using multiple 12V rails to meet the 240 VA Safety Requirement, which would limit each 12V rail to 20 amps each.” In many ways, the onus is now on motherboard manufacturers for pre-built systems. PSU manufacturers just have to strip down their existing PSUs to fit the new spec, while motherboard manufacturers have to integrate new technology onto already-crowded PCBs and then find a way to cool it. Remember again one important point: This doesn’t necessarily mean a change to DIY enthusiast platforms -- at least, not immediately -- because it’s unifying existing proprietary power supplies from OEMs and SIs. The goal is to meet government regulations for pre-built systems. Those regulations do not extend to DIY enthusiast, and even further, there’s a “high expandability” loophole in the regulation that essentially says any system with a discrete GPU is presently immune to these requirements. That means that high-end Origin, Maingear, Cyberpower, or other enthusiast systems would be able to continue using off-the-shelf motherboards without needing special bucks on the boards. As mentioned earlier, the main motivation for anyone to adopt the ATX12VO standard is a new, stricter standard for assembled systems being sold in the state of California in July 2021. OEMs will now have to meet strict efficiency requirements at 20% and 50% load, not just at 100%. Further, Intel is trying to get companies up to speed with a 2% load efficiency requirement, initially proposed to power supply makers around 2018. The relevant section of Title 20 for PSUs and ATX12VO is 1605.3, although there’s plenty more surrounding that section that governs other aspects of computers and monitors. These regulations will ONLY apply to new complete systems sold by OEMs and SIs, not DIY PCs and not PCs sold before Tier 2 goes into effect. Tier 1 is already in effect now, and Intel estimates that most desktop models will need to reduce idle power consumption by a further 5 watts to move to the next tier. The previous charts were examples of Energy Star and CEC requirements that PSU manufacturers might want or need to meet, while these charts are Intel’s own requirements, built into the spec. The biggest difference is that Intel specifies efficiency at 10W or 2% load, depending on the PSU size. Idle power efficiency should be one of the major advantages of ATX12VO, and Intel is preempting further energy regulations by establishing this 2% efficiency requirement. Intel says that sticking to a single rail will cut down on AC to DC conversion loss; the PSU engineers we spoke to confirmed that using 12V exclusively would allow PSUs to be more efficient. As reported by Gordon Mah Ung of PCWorld, supplying a low current across 3.3V, 5V, and 12V rails at all times makes PSUs only perhaps 50-60% efficient at idle. Moving to a single 12V rail raises idle efficiency and should help OEMs meet these requirements, but of course they’re free to choose other options instead. Speaking with an engineer from a power supply manufacturer we can’t name, we asked what the general opinion of ATX12VO was at present. The answer started like this: “I think it’s a good change for the wrong reasons. They're doing it because some PSU vendors claimed it was too hard/too expensive to meet the 2% load efficiency requirements with a multiple output PSU, so it's probably going to be something you'll only see with SIs since they need to meet that 2% requirement to pass CEC. And that requirement is only if you have a PC that doesn't meet the ‘high expandability’ loophole, so that's essentially any PC with a discrete graphics card. In fact, not even modern standby mode (currently) works with a discrete graphics card installed.” We asked about if this would impact the enthusiast or DIY market by proxy, and our same contact said: “It’s not going to. In my opinion, they should keep the PSU a +12V and +5V PSU. Get rid of +3.3V and -12V. Make the main connector smaller. But that's it. That would be much easier to adopt/digest.” Speaking with a source at a power supply factory, we asked some of the same questions. The contact confirmed that power supply efficiency is easier to increase with just 12V rails, and noted that this reduces cost for the PSU industry, but increases it for motherboards. As far as the purchaser of both would go -- that’d be the OEMs and SIs, mostly -- the cost would largely equalize. Cable cost goes down, DC-to-DC component cost goes down and shifts to the motherboard, and efficiency goes up. Our contact told us that in their personal opinion, upgrade pathways become more limited for consumers and the mixed standards for retail also complicates things, saying that they didn’t think it “makes sense” overall. Next, we asked Jon Gerow of Corsair, formerly of JonnyGuru, about if this would move some of the requirements from the power supply to the motherboard. He answered: \"Yes. You still need +3.3V and +5V, so you're just moving the DC to DC from the PSU to the motherboard. And since they made the new standard have a +12VSB, you'll also need DC to DC to get USB ports to work and work in standby.\" We also asked Gerow if economies of scale and mass production would move ATX12VO and ATX12V power supply standards toward each other, eventually getting into the DIY space. He replied: \"Not really. Dell, HP and Lenovo already use a 12V Only type of solution, but their connectors are proprietary. Intel is just taking that idea and trying to standardize it. ATX12VO is an attempt at streamlining an ancient standard. As such, it removes some features without adding anything really exciting for DIY PC builders, but it also isn’t a standard aimed at DIY PC builders (for now). It’s ultimately up to OEMs whether this standard succeeds and becomes more widely adopted or not, but the factory we spoke to isn’t rushing to start selling ATX12VO PSUs. Intel has confirmed that they will continue to publish the normal ATX spec. Nobody is obligated to adopt ATX12VO, even OEMs. Their only obligation is to meet the CEC’s standards, and ATX12VO is one tool that Intel is offering to help. This isn’t pure altruism--Intel must have its own motives for promoting ATX12VO--but the sky isn’t falling, 12VO isn’t such a bad thing, and adoption by the DIY market will be gradual if it happens at all.

        "excerpt": "While dense retrieval has been shown effective and efficient across tasks and languages, it remains difficult to create effective fully zero-shot dense retrieval systems when no relevance label is available. In this paper, we recognize the difficulty of zero-shot learning and encoding relevance. Instead, we propose to pivot through Hypothetical Document Embeddings~(HyDE). Given a query, HyDE first zero-shot instructs an instruction-following language model (e.g. InstructGPT) to generate a hypothetical document. The document captures relevance patterns but is unreal and may contain false details. Then, an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder~(e.g. Contriever) encodes the document into an embedding vector. This vector identifies a neighborhood in the corpus embedding space, where similar real documents are retrieved based on vector similarity. This second step ground the generated document to the actual corpus, with the encoder's dense bottleneck filtering out the incorrect details. Our experiments show that HyDE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised dense retriever Contriever and shows strong performance comparable to fine-tuned retrievers, across various tasks (e.g. web search, QA, fact verification) and languages~(e.g. sw, ko, ja).",

        "excerpt": "Knowledge-intensive language tasks require NLP systems to both provide the correct answer and retrieve supporting evidence for it in a given corpus. Autoregressive language models are emerging as the de-facto standard for generating answers, with newer and more powerful systems emerging at an astonishing pace. In this paper we argue that all this (and future) progress can be directly applied to the retrieval problem with minimal intervention to the models' architecture. Previous work has explored ways to partition the search space into hierarchical structures and retrieve documents by autoregressively generating their unique identifier. In this work we propose an alternative that doesn't force any structure in the search space: using all ngrams in a passage as its possible identifiers. This setup allows us to use an autoregressive model to generate and score distinctive ngrams, that are then mapped to full passages through an efficient data structure. Empirically, we show this not only outperforms prior autoregressive approaches but also leads to an average improvement of at least 10 points over more established retrieval solutions for passage-level retrieval on the KILT benchmark, establishing new state-of-the-art downstream performance on some datasets, while using a considerably lighter memory footprint than competing systems.

For instance, states might need to verify that powerful AI models are widely deployed only after their risks to international security have been evaluated and deemed manageable. However, research on AI verification could benefit from greater clarity and detail. To address this, this report provides an in-depth overview of AI verification, intended for both policy professionals and technical researchers. We present novel conceptual frameworks, detailed implementation options, and key R&D challenges. These draw on existing literature, expert interviews, and original analysis, all within the scope of confidentially overseeing AI development and deployment that uses thousands of high-end AI chips. We find that states could eventually verify compliance by using six largely independent verification approaches with substantial redundancy: (1) built-in security features in AI chips; (2-3) separate monitoring devices attached to AI chips; and (4-6) personnel-based mechanisms, such as whistleblower programs. While promising, these approaches require guardrails to protect against abuse and power concentration, and many of these technologies have yet to be built or stress-tested. To enable states to confidently verify compliance with rules on large-scale AI development and deployment, the R&D challenges we list need significant progress.",

        "excerpt": "Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it \"U-SOPHISTRY\" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.",

        "excerpt": "As AI systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other AIs. We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.",

In this preregistered, large-scale incentivized experiment, participants (quiz takers) completed an online quiz where persuaders (either humans or LLMs) attempted to persuade quiz takers toward correct or incorrect answers. We find that LLM persuaders achieved significantly higher compliance with their directional persuasion attempts than incentivized human persuaders, demonstrating superior persuasive capabilities in both truthful (toward correct answers) and deceptive (toward incorrect answers) contexts. We also find that LLM persuaders significantly increased quiz takers' accuracy, leading to higher earnings, when steering quiz takers toward correct answers, and significantly decreased their accuracy, leading to lower earnings, when steering them toward incorrect answers. Overall, our findings suggest that AI's persuasion capabilities already exceed those of humans that have real-money bonuses tied to performance. Our findings of increasingly capable AI persuaders thus underscore the urgency of emerging alignment and governance frameworks.",
